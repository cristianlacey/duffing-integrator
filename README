Hello! Welcome to my program. Please make yourself at home.
There's leftover "piazza" in the fridge.

Running "make" generates 3 executables that solve the duffing equation,
decomposed as a system of first-order differential equations in the form
x_dot = Ax + B. To change the equation to be solved, simply replace the
entries of A and B in duffing.c, along with n, the number of dimensions of
the state vector. Each executable solves the equation using one of the
following numerical methods:
Euler
4th Order Runge-Kutta
2nd Order Adams-Bashforth

Required files for compiling executables include:
duffing.c
euler.c
rk4.c
ab2.c
integrator.h
Makefile
